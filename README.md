## Summary

This repo contains work performed by Jackie Nichols, Hao Wu, Song Park, and Robert Link for our capstone project in W210 at UC Berkeley.  

## Abstract

There have been recent stories surrounding the challenges within the criminal justice system that have been brought to light as a result of greater access to data. For example, some recent research has shown that African Americans face harsher treatment than whites in the criminal justice system. Minority groups in general tend to face harsher sentencing including longer prison sentences. Equity in the criminal justice system is in question and there is data that help provide greater transparency around the criminal justice system. Drawing inspiration from the following 

- the award-winning "Bias on the Bench" 2016 series from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, (http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/) 
- The story of Walter McMillian, who, with the help of Bryan Stevenson a defense attorney, appealed his murder conviction as depicted in the movie Just Mercy
- The team at American Equity and Justice Group whose goal is to provide transparency into the WA criminal justice system


### Introduction

Our MVP goal is to provide greater transparency into sentencing of Black and White Americans in the United States (US) criminal justice system, through simple yet impactful analytics beginning first with the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC). In addition to analytics, the DAATE MVP provides statistical guidelines for evidence of sentencing bias through exploring causality, as well as providing easily interpretable, statistical model-based sentence time predictions. 

DAATE is intended to be an advisory tool for defense attorneys to gain additional insight about potential inequity in sentencing, and to aid in the attorneys case preparation to represent and to seek fair and equal treatment for their client.

### Mission

To empower legal professionals to realize fairness and equity for their clients by providing transparency into sentencing in the US criminal justice system using data science techniques.

### Our Results
